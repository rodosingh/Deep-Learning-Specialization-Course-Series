This includes the solution files for the programming assignments of each of the 5 courses in Deep Learning Series.

***Important Note***
Click on the latest notebook version to fetch required solution.

The first course is "Neural Networks and Deep Learning". 
This course is 4-weeks long.

The second one is "Improving Deep Neural Networks: Hyperparameter tuning, Regularization and Optimization".
It's 3-weeks long.

Third one is "Structuring Machine Learning Projects".
It doesn't contain any programming assignments and it's the shortest among all with 2-weeks only.

Fourth is "Convolutional Neural Networks".
It's four weeks long and hence a considerable amount of programming assignments are there.

And the final and fifth one is "Sequence Models".
3-weeks long and consists of some nice programming assignments.
